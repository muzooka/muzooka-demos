        <div>Yes, you did just read it. To summarize - although most of it would be familiar to most of you - Iron Maiden got their break with their eponymous 1980 debut, while albums like "The number of the beast" (1982), "Piece of mind" (1983) och "Powerslave"
          (1984) made them the undisputed superstars of heavy metal. The anthemic melodies, the dueling guitars, the galloping bass, the intriguing lyrics, Bruce Dickinson's grandiose vocals, the ever-changing mascot Eddie - this all adds up to an identity
          unique in heavy metal, and in all of music. Following the tour for their latest blockbuster "The book of souls" (2015) - the band's 16th studio album - Iron Maiden in 2018 begin their colossal arena- and festival tour "Legacy of the beast world
          tour". This will feature a setlist ripe with 80s' material plus a selection of surprises from the band's more recent output. And also a stage production as majestic as it is multi-faceted - not least as far as Eddie is concerned. In short, this
          historical SRF debut could not take place under better circumstances. As Bruce Dickinson would, and in all probability will, say: "Scream for me, Sweden Rock!"</div>

        <div>One of the greatest legends in metal, and the one who has succeded the most as becoming a superstar twice. As the frontman of Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne co-remodeled rock music forever with songs like "Paranoid" and "Iron man". As a solo artist
          he has released ten studio albums since 1980, packed with more classics like "Crazy train", "Mr Crowley", "Bark at the moon", "No more tears" and "Gets me through", to name but a few. Ozzy is also renowned for all the great guitarists who have
          been part of his solo band. Besides iconic original guitarist Randy Rhoads (1956-1982), the most beloved of them all would probably be Zakk Wylde, who has had multiple stints with Ozzy since 1987 as well as become famous in his own right with
          Black label Society. We are happy to inform you that Ozzy, with Zakk back by his side, will make their only concert on Swedish soil this time around at SRF 2018.</div>

        <div>Whether they invented heavy metal is debatable, but they were the first to call themselves heavy metal with pride. They also launched heavy metal's distinct "studs and leather"-esthetics and have time and again redefined the genre on albums like
          "Sad wings of destiny" (1976), "British steel" (1980), "Screaming for vengeance" (1982) och "Painkiller" (1990). Judas Priest are, plain and simple, heavy metal personified, and ever bit as popular and influential after all these years. The
          band of today consists of core trio Rob Halford (vocals), Glenn Tipton (guitar) and Ian Hill (bass), long-standing drummer Scott Travis and guitarist Richie Faulkner. The first album by this lineup, "Redeemer of souls" (2014), was a great success,
          and the highly anticipated followup "Firepower" (Judas Priest's 18th album in all) will conveniently arrive just in time before SRF.</div>

          has continued making music with great success. Which of course has made their classic lineup - featuring singer Michael Kiske (Unisonic) and guitarist/singer Kai Hansen (Gamma Ray, Unisonic) even more legendary, not least to new fans who never
          got to see it perform. Now they finally get the chance. Helloween's hugely anticipated "Pumpkins United" tour, featuring the present lineup PLUS Kiske and Hansen, will land at SRF 2018. Needless to say, the concert will be an extra long one.</div>

          the EP "Metal conquest" (1981) and the albums "Death or glory" (1982) and "Stronger than evil" (1983). The band has now been reunited by brothers Ragne (vocals, guitar) and Styrbjörn Wahlquist (vocals, drums) and Torbjörn Ragnesjö (bass), and
          the fourth classic member Eddy Malm (vocals, guitar) will appear as "special guest" at SRF. The setlist will contain songs from every record and one or two brand new tracks may appear as well.</div>

        <div>Norway's most celebrated and cult-certified band ever? Turbonegro describe themselves as "deathpunk", and their eclectic career displays their punk attitude to the extent that they have often rebeled even against punk itself. Their third album
          "Ass cobra" (1996) made them a cult band, the proto-glam infused "Apocalypse dudes" (1998) brought them to the verge of stardom - and then they split. However, their fanbase kept growing, and when Turbonegro returned in 2006 the joy of the public
          was immense. Just as it was when they heard the news that the band will release their first album in six years this February, called "Rock'n'roll machine".</div>

        <div>Pop Evil is the band who Mötley Crüe guitarist Mick Mars guested in the "Boss's daughter" promo video in 2012. The Michigan band combines the happy-go-lucky vibe of Kiss and, yes, Mötley Crüe with the seriousness of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam.
          On their native soil they have had great success with five albums since 2008 (number six is in the making), that have produced numerous hits like the aforementioned "Boss's daughter", "Trenches", "Deal with the Devil", "Torn to pieces" och "Footsteps".
          Pop Evil's Swedish apperaneces have been few and relatively modest - until now.</div>

        <div>The band who opens the entire festival are four 12- to 13-year-old boys from Sweden. Despite their age they are a routined act that have been together for two years, performed at other major festivals, and even won one of Sweden's most prestigious
          music competitions "Livekarusellen". (Their appearance in "Sweden's got talent" will be broadcast in the fall of 2018.) Three Dead Fingers released their debut EP in October 2017 and play a hybrid of thrash metal, heavy metal and nu metal. Their
          main influences are Slipknot, Korn, Sepultura and Rise Against.</div>
